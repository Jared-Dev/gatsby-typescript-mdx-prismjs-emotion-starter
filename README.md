# Gatsby TypeScript MDX Prismjs Starter w/ Emotion

Demo: <https://gatsby-ts-starter.netlify.com/>

## Origins

This project was forked from Tyler Greulich's [project](https://github.com/tylergreulich/gatsby-typescript-mdx-prismjs-starter) which uses `styled-components` instead of `emotion`. Additionally, it includes the scaffolding for generating a `sitemap.xml`. Beyond that it should be the same!

## Getting started

Install this by running the following from your CLI:

```bash
$ gatsby new my-website https://github.com/Jared-Dev/gatsby-typescript-mdx-prismjs-emotion-starter
```

Run `yarn start` to serve your website on <http://localhost:8000>.

Run `yarn build` to create a static site ready to host from (`/public`)
